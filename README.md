âœ¨ Hi! I'm [Marcy Sutton](https://marcysutton.com), an award-winning independent web developer, accessibility specialist, and creator of [testingaccessibility.com](https://testingaccessibility.com). You can hire me as a consultant or workshop trainer to help your team level up with accessibility! Think of me as a specialist lead engineer you can bring on part time. Read about the services I offer [on my website](https://marcysutton.com/services). Beyond my love for building accessible user interfaces, my experience also includes working on docs and accessibility at Gatsby and on the Axe accessibility testing library. My repos contain a mix of all of those things. ðŸŒˆ

Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was caring for my family, out riding a bicycle, hiking with my dog, lifting weights, or snowboarding. (Or perhaps I was working with a client in some internal capacity.) Life is short. Enjoy it!
