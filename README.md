âœ¨ Hi! I'm [Marcy Sutton](https://marcysutton.com), an award-winning independent web developer and accessibility specialist. You can hire me as a consultant or workshop trainer! Read about the services I offer [on my website](https://marcysutton.com/services). Beyond my love for building accessible user interfaces, my experience also includes working on docs and accessibility at Gatsby and on the [axe](https://deque.com/axe) accessibility testing library. My repos contain a mix of all of those things. ðŸŒˆ

Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was out riding a bicycle, hiking with my dog, lifting weights, or snowboarding. (Or perhaps I was working with a client in some internal capacity.) Life is short. Enjoy it!
