âœ¨ Hi! I'm [Marcy Sutton Todd](https://marcysutton.com), an award-winning senior developer of web applications at Principle Studios, a remote design and development studio. Previously, I worked as an independent engineer consultant and launched the workshop series [testingaccessibility.com](https://testingaccessibility.com). My experience has also included leading the Learning team at Gatsby, working on the Axe-core and Angular frameworks, and much more. ðŸŒˆ

Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was caring for my family, out riding a bicycle, hiking with my dog, lifting weights, or snowboarding. (Or perhaps my code is all on Azure DevOps instead of GitHub.) Life is short. Enjoy it!
