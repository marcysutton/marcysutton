âœ¨ Hi! I'm [Marcy Sutton](https://marcysutton.com), an award-winning web developer and accessibility specialist. I've worked at Gatsby and on the [axe](https://deque.com/axe) accessibility testing library, and I love building inclusive user interfaces. My repos contain a mix of all of those things. ðŸŒˆ

Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was out riding a bicycle, hiking with my dog, or snowboarding. Life is short!
