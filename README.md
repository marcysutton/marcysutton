âœ¨ Hi! I'm [Marcy Sutton Todd](https://marcysutton.com), an award-winning senior frontend developer at Khan Academy. I've worked at Principle Studios / Shift Paradigm, Gatsby.js, Deque Systems, Adobe, Substantial, Pop, and DEI Creative. I've worked on websites, web frameworks and libraries, including axe-core, Gatsby, Angular, and numerous design systems and component libraries. I've also worked as an independent engineer consultant and in 2022 I launched the workshop series [testingaccessibility.com](https://testingaccessibility.com). ðŸŒˆ

Where my contribution graph is blank, it's probably because I was caring for my family, out riding a bicycle, hiking with my dog, lifting weights, or snowboarding. (Or perhaps my code is all on Azure DevOps or GitHub Enterprise instead of GitHub.) Life is short. Enjoy it!
